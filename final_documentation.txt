Along with your code, unit tests, and any supporting files, you will also need to provide some documentation. 
This documentation should contain:

One to four sentences explaining what your project is and what it does.
An explanation on how to run the program from the command line.
Documentation on how to use the program / how to interpret the output of the program.
An annotated bibliography of all sources you used to develop the program and how you used them.
